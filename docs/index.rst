web-transmute
=============

web-transmute is a core library to create "transmute" toolboxes for
web frameworks. A transmute toolbox provides the following:

* generation of http handlers by reading function signatures.
* serialization to and from a variety of content types (e.g. json or yaml).
* serialization to and from native python objects, using `schematics <http://schematics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
* documentation of handlers generated this way, via `swagger <http://swagger.io/>`_.

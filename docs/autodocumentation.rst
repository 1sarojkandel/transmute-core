For transmute routes, transmute-core provides functionality for
documentation generation via `Swagger <http://swagger.io/>`_. This is performed
by reading the schematics model.

The swagger apis are dependent on the framework, so refer the
documentation for that project. In general, a function to generate a
swagger html page and a swagger.json is provided.

Serializers can be modified and extended via extending :ref:`transmute-context <transmute-context>`.
